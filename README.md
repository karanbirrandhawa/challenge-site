# challenge-site

This is the front-end repo for ChallengeHub.
This repo was apart of our Hack for BattleHacks Toronto.
This consists of the front-end which was built with React.js

ChallengeHub was a hack for BattleHacks Toronto which
focuses on enabling technology companies to build great
open source commmunites around their open source projects.

ChallengeHub is a web application that allows companies
to create "challenges" with the option of monetary prizes 
for extra incentive. These challenges could be new
features or bug fixes to a company's open source repo.

So here's something you may be thinking: Why did we build this?

We built this because as developers using open source software
we've always felt that sometimes there isn't enough incentive
for developers to contribute to open source projects. We've
always found great Open Source projects that have alot of
unaddressed issues because there isn't enough developer
support.

We've also felt that as developers, it's always difficult
to quantitatively measure how good developer X is by his
resume. We thought that this would be great way for companies 
to get better insight into the hiring process by tracking the contributions
that a potential employee is currently giving to your projects.
As an employer you can directly see the impact a developer has made
to software that millions of developers around the world could be
potentially using.

Also from a hiring standpoint, with real code and a large code base,
you can measure see someone's engineering skills at work. You can see
how someone can: navigate through a large code base, breakdown a problem, 
overcome barriers to make innovative solutions, write good maintainable code 
and deliver value to you instantly.
